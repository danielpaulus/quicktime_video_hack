Release 0.6

- qvh without Gstreamer is finally stable. I ran it for 16 hours straight on parallel devices and it worked flawlessly.
- before a 1.0 Release I need to see if Gstreamer is stable enough and maybe fix or switch to ffmpeg
- Linux support is still a bit broken

## 1. What is this?

This is an Operating System indepedent implementation for Quicktime Screensharing for iOS devices :-)

[Check out my presentation](https://danielpaulus.github.io/quicktime_video_hack_presentation)

[See a demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/8v5f_ybSjHk)

This repository contains all the code you will need to grab and record video and audio from one or more iPhone(s) or iPad(s)
without needing one of these expensive MacOS X computers or the hard to use QuickTime Player :-D

- You can record video and audio as raw h264 and wave audio in the Apple demonstration mode (Device shows 9:41am, full battery and no cellphone carrier in the status bar)
- Also you can just grab device audio as wave, ogg or mp3 without the Apple demonstration mode now ðŸŽ‰
- You can use custom Gstreamer Pipelines to transcode the AV data into whatever you like

## 1.2 What's next?

I will work on stabilizing Linux support next. On my current ubuntu box I need to disable the Camera mode, kill usbmuxd and restart the tool like 20 times before it works. It's really hard to get going.
Also, let me know if you have ideas what needs to be added.

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Mac OSX

1. On MacOS run `brew install libusb pkg-config gstreamer gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-ugly`
2. To just run: Download the latest release and run it
3. To develop: Clone the repo and execute `go run main.go` (need to install golang of course)

### 2.2 Linux

1. Run with Docker: the Docker files are [here](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/tree/master/docker). There is one for just building and one for running.

2. If you want to build/run locally then copy paste the dependencies from this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.debian) and install with apt.
3. Git clone the repo and start hacking or download the latest release and run the binary :-D

## 3. Usage

- For just displaying the screen run `qvh gstreamer` and it will work.
- For troubleshooting run `qvh diagnostics metrics.csv --dump=binary.bin` which will log all important and dump everything to files.
- For just getting raw media output without Gstreamer involved use `qvh record out.h264 out.wav` or `qvh audio out.wav --wav` for audio only

```
Q.uickTime V.ideo H.ack (qvh) v0.6-beta

Usage:
  qvh devices [-v]
  qvh activate [--udid=<udid>] [-v]
  qvh record <h264file> <wavfile> [--udid=<udid>] [-v]
  qvh audio <outfile> (--mp3 | --ogg | --wav) [--udid=<udid>] [-v]
  qvh gstreamer [--pipeline=<pipeline>] [--examples] [--udid=<udid>] [-v]
  qvh diagnostics <outfile> [--dump=<dumpfile>] [--udid=<udid>]
  qvh --version | version


Options:
  -h --help       Show this screen.
  -v              Enable verbose mode (debug logging).
  --version       Show version.
  --udid=<udid>   UDID of the device. If not specified, the first found device will be used automatically.

The commands work as following:
        devices         lists iOS devices attached to this host and tells you if video streaming was activated for them

        activate        enables the video streaming config for the device specified by --udid

        record          will start video&audio recording. Video will be saved in a raw h264 file playable by VLC.
                        Audio will be saved in a uncompressed wav file. Run like: "qvh record /home/yourname/out.h264 /home/yourname/out.wav"

        audio           Records only audio from the device. It does not change the status bar like the video recording mode does.
                        The recorded audio will be saved in <outfile> with the selected format. Currently (--mp3 | --ogg | --wav) are supported.
                        Adding more formats is trivial though so create an issue or a PR if you need something :-)

        gstreamer       If no additional param is provided, qvh will open a new window and push AV data to gstreamer.
                        If "qvh gstreamer --examples" is provided, qvh will print some common gstreamer pipeline examples.
                        If --pipeline is provided, qvh will use the provided gstreamer pipeline instead of
                        displaying audio and video in a window.

        diagnostics     The diagnostics mode is added for running longterm tests to debug and ensure stability.
                        It will log several metrics and debug logs. Optionally specify a dump file with the --dump option that
                        will store raw bytes of all messages. Be aware though, that this file will grow quite large over time.
```

## 4. Technical Docs/ Roll your own implementation

QVH probably does something similar to what `QuickTime` and `com.apple.cmio.iOSScreenCaptureAssistant` are doing on MacOS.
I have written some documentation here [doc/technical_documentation.md](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/blob/master/doc/technical_documentation.md)
So if you are just interested in the protocol or if you want to implement this in a different programming language than golang, read the docs.
Also I have extracted binary dumps of all messages for writing unit tests and re-develop this in your preferred language in a test driven style.

I have given up on windows support :-)
~~[Port to Windows](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/tree/windows/windows) (I don't know why, but still people use Windows nowadays)~~ Did not find a way to do it
