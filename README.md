## 1. What is this?
This is an Operating System indepedent implementation for Quicktime Screensharing for iOS devices :-)
This repository contains all the code you will need to grab and record video and audio from your iPhone or iPad 
without needing one of these expensive MacOS X computers :-D
It probably does something similar to what `QuickTime` and `com.apple.cmio.iOSScreenCaptureAssistant` are doing on MacOS.
Currently you can use it to create a h264 file that is playable with VLC and watch a recording of your devices screen :-D
If you want to contribute to code or documentation, please go ahead :-D

## 2. Technical Docs
I have written some documentation here [doc/technical_documentation.md](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/blob/master/doc/technical_documentation.md)
So if you are just interested in the protocol or if you want to implement this in a different programming language than golang, read the docs.
## 3. Usage& Current State of the Tool
run `go run main.go --help` to see how it works

To run RTP you can use this gstreamer command 
```
gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=4000 caps = "application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264, payload=(int)96" ! rtph264depay ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```
and then run `go run main.go rtpstream localhost 4000`

Progress:
1. ~~Make the `go run main.go dumpraw` work on the first execution (currently you have to run it twice and it will start recording on the second run)~~
2. FIX: After running the dumpraw command and saving a video, you have to unplug the device to record another video currently
3. Make a release :-D
4. Generate GStreamer compatible x264 stream probably by wrapping the NaLus in RTP headers
5. ~~Complete packet documentation~~
6. Send correct replies for clock SKEW packets


Extra Goals:

0. Also save the device audio stream (I am already decoding it and receiving it, just not doing anything with it for now) 
1. [Port to Windows](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack/tree/windows/windows) (I don't know why, but still people use Windows nowadays)


## 4. Additional Notes
### MAC OS X LIBUSB -- IMPORTANT
1. What works:
 You can enable the QuickTime config and discover QT capable devices with `qvh devices` and  `qvh activate` 

2. What does not work

This might be wrong, needs investigation--> `qvh dumpraw` won't work on MAC OS because the binary needs to be codesigned with `com.apple.ibridge.control`
 apparently that is a protected Entitlement that I have no idea how to use or sign my binary with. 

2. Make sure to use either this fork `https://github.com/GroundControl-Solutions/libusb`
   or a LibUsb version BELOW 1.0.20 or iOS devices won't be found on Mac OS X.
